Readings From Sensors is an IoT web application that collects near real-time data - such as temperature, humidity, and vibration - from remote assets, including construction equipment and office buildings. The application presents this information on a browser-based dashboard, allowing users to monitor and analyse their assets from anywhere.

The platform is built with a React frontend, PHP backend, and MySQL database, and leverages the LoRaWAN protocol in the EU868 MHz band for reliable device-to-network communication. Data from connected sensors is managed via The Things Network IoT network server.
